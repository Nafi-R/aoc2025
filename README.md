# Advent of Code 2025 – Rust Solutions

This repository contains my solutions for [Advent of Code 2025](https://adventofcode.com/2025), implemented in Rust.

## Structure

- Each day's solution is located in `src/days/dayN.rs`, where `N` is the day number.
- The main entry point is in `src/main.rs`.
- Utility modules and shared code are in `src/utils/`.

## Running Solutions

To run the solution for a specific day:

```bash
cargo run --release -- <day> [input_file]
```

- `<day>`: The day number (e.g., `day1`, `day2`, ...)
- `[input_file]`: Optional path to the input file. If omitted, the program will look for `data/dayN.txt`.

## Requirements

- Rust (edition 2021 or later)
- Cargo
